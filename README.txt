Explaination of code examples:
All code examples are from an android application for Vesta Technologies.
I was tasked with redesigning their application. All the code examples are either completely written by me or completely rewriten by me.

DeviceContentActivity.java: Completely rewritten to add and change original features. This page recieves and sends information from the device and allows the user to control the device

Guide folder: This section of the application was completely written from scratch from me. This section pulls information from a XML sheet and parses it and uses that information to generate a guide for users to select a product and cooklevel and receive cooking directions
